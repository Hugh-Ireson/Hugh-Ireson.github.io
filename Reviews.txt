After several months working with Humam, our grandson moved up to the Accelerated Learning Program for Y9 students.  Humam is applying a consistent learning and revision program that handshakes with grandson's school's Math curriculum.  This keeps the lad right on top of where he needs to be.  We have watched his love of Math become confident and enquiring.  Thank you Humam.
