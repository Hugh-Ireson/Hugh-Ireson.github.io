Bike Sharing Dataset

Abstract
This report presents an analysis of the Bike Sharing dataset from Washington, focusing on insights derived through data cleaning, data visualization, time series analysis, and descriptive data analysis. The dataset includes information on registered and casual bike users, temperature, season, weather conditions, and year, providing a rich foundation for exploring usage patterns and external factors influencing bike-sharing behaviour. The analysis began with data cleaning to address missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers, ensuring the dataset's integrity. Data visualization techniques, including line charts, bar plots, and heatmaps, were employed to uncover trends in bike usage across different user types (registered vs. casual), seasonal fluctuations, and weather-related impacts. Time series analysis was applied to identify temporal patterns in bike-sharing activity, revealing usage peaks during specific seasons, weather conditions, and months, as well as yearly trends. Descriptive data analysis was used to compute key statistics, such as average trip duration, user distribution by type, and correlations between weather and bike usage. The findings offer valuable insights into how temperature, seasonality, and weather conditions affect bike-sharing usage, informing strategies for improving service availability and user experience in Washington's bike-sharing system.
